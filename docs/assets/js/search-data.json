RecapSyscall MechanismSyscall ImplementationQuiz 1 will be on Friday, first 10 min of class.10 MCQ online, no cheat sheet.Don't be late!It will include content from today!Rest of PA2 released. If I'm quick, we'll getthrough almost everything you need today.System calls are the kernel's API for user-modeprograms to interact with hardware and system-critical functions.User-mode programs - see syscalls as normal functions - cannot access kernel stuffSystem Call requires CPU context switchSystem Calls are OS-dependent, often not portableHardware invocation mechanism is arch dependent2 general approaches:Syscall parameters are passed via registers.For example, in x86 assembly:On the syscall instruction, the CPU:Hardware saves program counterHardware jumps to entry in kernel-modeKernel assembly procedure saves registersKernel initializes new stack and dispatchesSystem call code runsScheduler decides which process to return toKernel assembly restores process contextKernel restores PC and leaves kernel modeThen the kernel entry code takes over.Kernel entry code determines which syscall toinvoke by looking up the syscall number in a table.Internal prototypes:Arch-specific:Syscall Table:Macro SYSCALL_DEFINE2 declares a syscall with2 arguments. For each argument, the macro takesthe type and name as separate fields.Return value will be returned to user process.copy_{to/from}_user copies data between kerneland process address space.Important:Kernel should never trust the user!Kernel should not abuse its powers!Kernel should copy user data to kernel spacebefore manipulating it, then copy it back to userspace.User Space Memory Access API:Write your syscall functionTo add your syscall to the build system:Pros: - Adding syscalls is \"easy\"Cons: - Need official syscall number - Interface changes are permanent - Must be registered for every architecture - Not always necessaryAlternative: - Device or virtual file (kernel modules) - Can alter behavior of existing syscalls (e.g. read, write, ioctl)- Add a file: - Modify top-level Makefile:- contents:- contents:(Assume syscall code @ )Add syscall to syscall table (arch-specific)Add syscall prototype to header fileRebuild and reinstall kernelTest with libc syscall function from user code- In an existing file (not for PA 2)- x86: - Use tabs between fields- common:- or arch-specific equivalent- Recompile kernel- Reinstall modules- Reinstall kernel- Reboot with new kernel- In an new file if self-contained - Add file to build system- User-space cannot access kernel-space memory- Kernel-space can access user-space memory- Kernel must check user-provided pointers- Kernel must never execute user-space memory- Minimize access to user-space memorythe table is used by the Linux build systemTrap Modelcolumn 1:column 2:column 3:column 4:syscall numberarchitecture availabilitysyscall nameinternal function name- Similar to hardware interrupt mechanismInterrupt InstructionSpecial InstructionIdea: fake an interrupt (hardware interrupts trigger kernel-mode)Idea: special hardware logic to perform mode and context switchEx. Intel &amp; AMD originally had sysenter/syscall, with differenthardware mechanisms. Now, both use syscall in 64-bit systemse.g. UNIX calls completely different from WindowsKernel code only executes under 2 conditions:(See also MOS Figure 1-18)Process ManagementFile SystemMiscellaneous- hardware access - read/write/manage files in storage devices - read/write to I/O devices- create processes- change security permissions- interrupt- system call1)2)3)pid = fork()pid = waitpid(pid, &amp;statloc, options)s = execve(name, argv, environp)exit(status)create a child process identical to parentwait for child to terminatereplace a process's core imageterminate process execution and return statusfd = open(file, mode, ...)s = close(fd)n = read(fd, buffer, len)n = write(fd, buffer, len)pos = lseek(fd, offset, whence)s = stat(name, &amp;buf)s = mkdir(name, mode)s = rmdir(name)s = link(name1, name2)s = unlink(name)s = mount(special, name, flag)s = unmount(special)open a fileclose an open fileread data from file to bufferwrite data from buffer to filemove the file pointerget file status informationcreate directoryremove empty directorycreate an entry name2 that points to name1remove an entrymount a file systemunmount a file systems = chdir(dirname)s = chmod(name, mode)s = kill(pid, signal)sec = time(&amp;seconds)change working directorychange file's protection bitssend signal to processget seconds since 1/1/1970 .

If I'm quick, we'll getthrough almost everything you need today.System calls are the kernel's API for user-modeprograms to interact with hardware and system-critical functions.User-mode programs - see syscalls as normal functions - cannot access kernel stuffSystem Call requires CPU context switchSystem Calls are OS-dependent, often not portableHardware invocation mechanism is arch dependent2 general approaches:Syscall parameters are passed via registers.For example, in x86 assembly:On the syscall instruction, the CPU:Hardware saves program counterHardware jumps to entry in kernel-modeKernel assembly procedure saves registerskernel initializes new stack and dispatchesSystem call code runsScheduler decides which process to return toKernel assembly restores process contextKernel restores PC and leaves kernel modeThen the kernel entry code takes over.Kernel entry code determines which syscall toinvoke by looking up the syscall number in a table.Internal prototypes:Arch-specific:Syscall Table:Macro SYSCALL_DEFINE2 declares a syscall with2 arguments. For each argument, the macro takesthe type and name as separate fields.Return value will be returned to user process.copy_{to/from}_user copies data between kerneland process address space.Important:Kernel should never trust the user!Kernel should not abuse its powers!Kernel should copy user data to kernel spacebefore manipulating it, then copy it back to userspace.User Space Memory Access API:Write your syscall functionTo add your syscall to the build system:Pros: - Adding syscalls is \"easy\"Cons: - Need official syscall number - Interface changes are permanent - Must be registered for every architecture - Not always necessaryAlternative: - Device or virtual file (kernel modules) - Can alter behavior of existing syscalls (e.g. read, write, ioctl)- Add a file: - Modify top-level Makefile:- contents:- contents:(Assume syscall code @ )Add syscall to syscall table (arch-specific)Add syscall prototype to header fileRebuild and reinstall kernelTest with libc syscall function from user code- In an existing file (not for PA 2)- x86: - Use tabs between fields- common:- or arch-specific equivalent- Recompile kernel- Reinstall modules- Reinstall kernel- Reboot with new kernel- In an new file if self-contained - Add file to build system- User-space cannot access kernel-space memory- Kernel-space can access user-space memory- Kernel must check user-provided pointers- Kernel must never execute user-space memory- Minimize access to user-space memorythe table is used by the Linux build systemTrap Modelcolumn 1:column 2:column 3:column 4:syscall numberarchitecture availabilitysyscall nameinternal function name- Similar to hardware interrupt mechanismInterrupt InstructionSpecial InstructionIdea: fake an interrupt (hardware interrupts trigger kernel-mode)Idea: special hardware logic to perform mode and context switchEx.

Remember to read each step before doing it! . 5.2.1 - Booting the VM . | Click the green “Start” arrow to start your virtual machine. | The virtual machine will automatically boot from its virtual CD and start the installation software, which is a special copy of OpenBSD. | . | You should see a boot> prompt. This is the OpenBSD bootloader, which allows you to select the kernel you want to use. In this case, you can wait 5 seconds or hit Enter to allow the bootloader to automatically select a kernel. After the kernel is selected, for a brief time, you should see text with numbers. This is the bootloader copying the selected kernel from the virtual CD into VM memory. | When the background turns blue it means the kernel itself is running. The kernel will print a bunch of info to the screen describing the hardware it detects. | (VirtualBox-only) Enlarging the screen if needed: . | Click “View” in the window’s upper left corner | Click “Virtual Screen 1” | Select a scaling percentage (can be changed again later) | . | . 5.2.2 - Network and User Configuration . After the kernel has finished booting, the OpenBSD install script will begin automatically and you will be presented with the “Install, Upgrade, Autoinstall, Shell” prompt. This installation script has many steps. Most are trivial, though a few are complex. Most will also have a default option between square brackets ([]), which is usually (but not always) correct. If you make a mistake during the installation procedure, you can press Ctrl-C to abort the script and restart from the beginning by typing install at the # prompt. | Type I and hit Enter to begin the install script. For the first portion of the script, configure OpenBSD according to the table below. | Setting | Value | Comment | . | Keyboard Layout | Default (US/English) | | . | System Hostname | obsd | | . | Network Interface to Configure | Default (em0) | OpenBSD’s name for the (virtual) hardware Ethernet network controller | . | IPv4 Address | Default (autoconf) | OpenBSD will use the DHCP network protocol to automatically configure an IP address for the Ethernet network interface of the VM. The installation script will also configure the system to automatically use DHCP to get an IP address every time you reboot the VM. | . | IPv6 Address | Default (none) | | . | Network Interface | Default (done) | | . | root Password | obsd | Note: on many Unix systems, passwords will not appear on-screen when typed in a shell. | . | Start sshd | no | Note: we do not want anyone using ssh to login to the VM. | . | Run X Window | Default (yes) | | . | Use xenodm | Default (no) | Note: you will learn how to start the X Window GUI manually later. | . | Setup User | Stevens login name | e.g. rtsang1 from rtsang1@stevens.edu. | . | Full Name | Your full name | | . | Password | obsd | Your user account password. | . | Time Zone | Default (EST) | Note: you can input ? for a list of available time zones. | . | . 5.2.3 - Hard Disk Configuration . At this point, you should be at hard disk configuration. A single hard disk can be divided into multiple “primary partitions”, with each partition storing a different operating system (sort of). For example, one primary partition could store Windows while another stores OpenBSD, and the OS to run could be chosen at boot-time using the bootloader. This is called multi-booting. In this stage we will first configure the Master Boot Record (MBR), which stores the number of primary partitions, their type, and their size, in the first sector (data block) of the hard disk. Then we will configure at least one file system. For simplicity, we will use a single primary partition occupying the entire virtual hard disk that has a single FFS file system for the root directory. Inside each primary partition, multiple file systems can be created for the same OS (if the OS supports it). For example, one OpenBSD FFS file system for the / root directory, and another FFS for the /home user home directories can be created in the same primary partition. Linux also supports multiple file systems in a partition, but uses ext4, but also supports ext2 and btrfs among others. By contrast, Windows only has one NTFS file system per primary partition (e.g. C: and D: drives). 5.2.3.1 - Root Disk and MBR Configuration . | Configure the root disk and MBR as follows: . | Setting | Value | Comment | . | root Disk | sd0 | To see a full list of available hard disks in the VM, type ? and hit Enter. sd0 should be the only option, with the name “VBOX HARDISK” (or “QEMU HARDISK” for Apple users on UTM), and a size of 6 GB. This is the hard disk where the OpenBSD primary partition and root filesystem will be created. | . | root Disk Encryption | Default (no) | This option encrypts the entire hard disk, which would affect performance if selected. | . | Whole disk MBR/GPT | Default (whole) | Since the disk is still empty, it does not yet have a Master Boot Record. When you select whole, the installation script will create a single primary partition using fdisk that will occupy the entirety of the virtual hard disk. Then it will create a new MBR for the partition. | . Note that the primary partition does not start in disk sector 2 (which immediately follows the MBR). Some empty disk space must be left between the MBR and the start of the partition to store the OpenBSD bootloader. fdisk automatically accounts for this. GPT is a more recent and more advanced version of the same kind of partition table that allows you to create more than 4 primary partitions. MBR with up to 4 partitions is plenty for us. | . 5.2.3.2 - File System Configuration . Now we need to create a single / root file system (rfs) in our primary partition. The install script automatically offers a default configuration of file systems, with a root file system in addition to /usr, /home, and “swap” file systems. (swap is used for memory management and will be revisited later in the course) . Since this is not what we want, we will configure our file system manually. | Start the custom file system configuration by entering c into the prompt. This will start OpenBSD’s disklabel interactive editor, and a new prompt (sd0> ) will appear. In this mode you will be able to specify the number of file systems to create, along with their location, size, type, and directory path (e.g. /, /usr, /home). You can enter ? into the prompt to get a list of available commands. | Enter a to add a new file system with the following configurations: . | Setting | Value | Comment | . | Partition | Default (a) | File system “a” on disk “sd0” will have a full name “sd0a”. Note that OpenBSD uses the word “partition” in place of “file system” for historical reasons. | . | Offset | Default | The offset indicates the hard disk sector number where the start of the file system will be placed in the primary partition. Do not try to change this unless you know how the file system is organized in the primary partition. | . | Size | Default | Size of the file system in number of disk sectors. The default value corresponds to the size of the entire primary partition. A different size (e.g. “3G”) could be specified to leave room for another file system. | . | FS Type | Default (4.2BSD) | Standard file system type for BSD systems (also called “FFS” or “UFS”). | . | Mount point | / | Mount the file system at the root directory. | . | When the prompt returns (sd0*> ), you can enter p to show the current state. You should see the a file system, and the unused c file system, which represents the whole primary partition. The * in the prompt indicates that the changes are pending; disklabel has not yet changed anything on the hard disk (much like git staging before commits). | When you are ready to commit changes to the disk, enter w, then q to quit disklabel. After quitting, the root file system should be initialized automatically, and you will see logs about /dev/sd0a. Note that this new file system is mounted at /mnt, not /. This is because the virtual CD was mounted at / on boot, and the installer program is currently using it. /mnt is a temporary mount point and the newly configured file system will be mounted at / the next time the VM boots from the virtual hard disk. | . 5.2.4 - Set Installation . “Installing the sets” refers to copying the OpenBSD operating system files (kernel, system utilities, man pages, GUI, etc.) to the root file system. | Install the sets according to the table below: . | Setting | Value | Comment | . | Location of sets | cd0 | The virtual CD (located at cd0) includes all the required file sets (file packages). | . | Pathname to sets | Default (X.Y/amd64) | This is the path on the CD to the location of the file sets. | . | Set names | Default (all, done) | . | bsd: kernel for mono-processor machines | bsd.mp: kernel for multiprocessor machines (installer will select right kernel automatically based on detected number of cores) | bsd.rd: special kernel for installation (currently in use) | baseXY.tgz: basic utilities (ls, etc.) | compXY.tgz: C compiler and C headers | manXY.tgz: manual pages | x*.tgz: X Window GUI files | . | . | Continue without verification | yes | The warning about missing SHA256.sig is normal for CD-based installation files, since adding a cryptographic signature file to the ISO file would alter the resulting file’s signature. | . | (Maybe) Location of sets | Default (done) | After the file sets are copied you may be prompted to install more software. We do not need to. | . | If you get a warning that says “Time appears wrong”, hit Enter and continue. | At this point, the installation script will automatially create special files in the /dev directory of your new system to access the (virtual) hardware (“making all device nodes…”). It will select the correct kernel (“using bsd.mp instead of bsd”). It may apply a firmware update if needed (fw_update). Firmware is a separate bit of software that runs directly on a hardware device components, like the disk controller or network controller. Firmware is not part of OpenBSD and is usually hardware-specific. OpenBSD will “re-link” (randomize) kernel code locations for security reasons (think ASLR). Finally, the script will silently install the OpenBSD bootloader on the hard disk between the MBR and the start of the primary partition. The bootloader is necessary so that the VM can locate and load the OpenBSD kernel. | Enter h to halt. Wait until you see “Please press any key to reboot”, then close the window. Do not use the default (reboot) option! . VirtualBox: Select “Power off the machine” in the prompt. The virtual installation CD needs to be ejected before we reboot the VM. | Eject the installation CD. virtualboxutm In VirtualBox: . | Open the VM’s settings. | Under “Storage”: . | Select the installXY.iso CD file. | Select the blue CD icon to the right of the “Optical Drive” menu. | Select “Remove Disk from Virtual Drive” to simulate ejecting the installation CD. | Click “OK”. | . | . In UTM: . | Stop the VM if it’s status is “Suspended” (“Stop” button in upper right corner). | Open the VM’s settings by right-clicking on the VM and selecting “Edit”. | Select the “IDE Drive” that corresponds to the installXY.iso file. | Select “Clear” next to the “Path” entry to remove the file from the virtual CD drive. | . | . 5.3 - Using OpenBSD . After starting the VM, you should see a similar sequence of steps. The boot>&#x20; prompt will appear for 5 seconds before copying the kernel into main memory. The text background will turn blue while the kernel is running. The difference this time is that the VM is booting from its own disk rather than the installation CD. After the kernel finishes booting, the system services will start, showing messages with a black background again. Some things you might see: . | syslogd: the OS message loggin service | ntpd: the system time service | smtpd: the system’s local email service | sndiod: system sound service | . All these services are part of the OpenBSD operating system, but they run as separate user-mode processes outside the kernel. 5.3.1 - Setting User Admin Privileges . | Login as root, use obsd password. This will get you a ksh shell by default with a prompt obsd#&#x20; (the system name followed by # to indicate admin user instead of the normal $). | Give your user account (your Stevens login name) admin privileges: . | cd /etc ; ls. Most OpenBSD system config files live here. | cp examples/doas.conf .. Create a doas.conf config file for the doas command (like sudo in Linux). The example config will automatically allow any user in the wheel user group to run commands as administrator. You can view the contents of the file with cat doas.conf. | Add your user account to the wheel group. Luckily, users created during the installation process are automatically added to the wheel group. You can check who is in the wheel group with grep using the command grep wheel /etc/group. | exit to exit the shell and return to the login prompt. | . | . 5.3.2 - Starting the X Window GUI . The text-based screen, or text user interface (TUI), where your shell runs is called the virtual console. OpenBSD (and Linux) have multiple virtual consoles available, but these are not always the most convenient. Instead, we will manually start the X Window GUI. | Login with your Stevens username (e.g. rtsang1) and obsd as your password. You will be logged in to your user home directory. Use pwd to see the current directory path, and ls -la to see a detailed list of files in the current directory. | Run doas xenodm to manually start the X Window GUI. Enter your the root password (obsd) and you should see the GUI. OpenBSD users do not usually need to use admin privileges with doas to start the X Window Gui, but it is required here because the VM has a very basic virtual graphics card. The default OpenBSD GUI is quite ugly. The bare X Window system minimally handles: . | the mouse | the keyboard | the computer screen | the FVWM window manager (allows you to have menus; create, move, and resize windows; etc.) | . OpenBSD has better GUIs available (e.g. KDE) but the bare GUI is enough for this assignment. | . 5.4 - Deliverables . To prove you have installed and used OpenBSD successfully, you will submit a screenshot showing the OpenBSD kernel version and the output of the id command. | Enlarge the text in the xterm terminal window. | Hold Ctrl+Right-Click in the center of the xterm window to see text size options and select “Huge”. | . | Run the following commands: . | uname -a to show OpenBSD kernel version. | id to show username and user groups. | . | Take a screenshot of the OpenBSD screen. You can use VirtualBox’s built-in option View -> Take Screenshot, or your host OS screenshot tools. An example can be seen in Figure Figure 1. Figure 1: OpenBSD Deliverable Example | Once you have a screenshot, you can shut down OpenBSD by running doas halt -p in the xterm window and enter the root password. This will halt the virtual machine (-p means powerdown), save files to the hard disk (“synching disks…done”), then power down the VM. | After powerdown, you can delete the entire VM as it will not be used again in this course. You can also delete the installXY.iso file. Congratulations on using OpenBSD! . | . ",

    "title": "6 - Installing Arch Linux",
    "content": "Arch Linux is interesting for you to install and use because: . | It has a text-based installation procedure which is even more minimalist than the OpenBSD one. While an installation script exists, it does not configure Linux as we would like, so we will be installing everything command by command. | It will show you that not all Linux distributions have GUI-based install procedures like Ubuntu or Debian. This is an opportunity to get comfortable in the command line if you haven’t done so already. | . 6.1 - Creating the Arch Linux VM . | Download Arch Linux: . | Go to the Arch Linux website and navigate to the “Download” page. | On the “Download” page, go to the “Worldwide” section, and click the first mirror link available. | Download the archlinux-x86_64.iso file. | . | Create a new VM in VirtualBox or UTM: . | Give the name “cs492-archlinux” to your new VM. | For the “ISO image”, select the archlinux-x86_64.iso file you just downloaded. | Under “Hardware”: . | Memory Size: 4096 MB | Processors: max physical cores | . | Under “Hard Disk”: . | Virtual hard disk size: 6 GB | . | . | (Apple UTM Users) Under “Display” in VM settings, change the “Emulated Display Card” to “VGA”, or you may see a blank screen when you try to install Arch. | . At this point, you should have a virtual machine with an empty 6 GB virtual disk, and a virtual CD containing the Arch Linux installation software. 6.2 - Installing Arch Linux on the VM . Remember to read each step carefully before doing it! . 6.2.1 - Booting the VM . | Start your virtual machine. The VM will automatically boot from its virtual CD and start running the installation software, a special copy of Arch. Similar to OpenBSD, you should see a menu come up. This is Arch’s installation bootloader, which will allow you to select the kernel to use, and will automatically select a kernel after 15 seconds. Once the kernel is selected, it will start. In Linux, kernel messages should show a timestamp at the beginning of the line. This may be blank (::) in the VM. As the kernel starts, systemd will start. systemd is a part of the Arch operating system, outside the kernel, that automatically starts various system services. It will show logging messages that start with a green [OK] if the corresponding service started successfully. After the kernel finishes booting, you will get a shell with the prompt root@archiso ~ # . This is normal, since Arch doesn’t have an installation script by default. Instead, you will now install Arch manually by executing the commands one by one. Note: “root” is the system administrator, “archiso” means you are running from the ISO-formatted installation CD, “ “ means you are currently in root’s home directory, and “#” is the traditional shell prompt when you are root. | If the text is too small in the terminal, run the command setfont -d to double the font size on the screen. Run setfont without flags to reset the font size. | . 6.2.2 - Network Configuration . | Arch should have automatically connected to the Internet via the VM’s Ethernet network interface. To verify this, execute ping archlinux.org. If the network is set up correctly, you should see ping responses (it may take a while to run on UTM due to emulation). Stop ping with Ctrl-C. | . 6.2.3 - Hard Disk Configuration . As with OpenBSD, we need to create a primary partition for Arch and a Linux file system inside this primary partition. However, where OpenBSD automated some of this process for us, we will need to use the fdisk utility ourselves to do so. 6.2.3.1 - Root Disk and MBR Configuration . | List hard disk names with fdisk -l. Ignore /dev/loop disks, as these are fake disks used by Linux internally. You should see a /dev/sda disk with a size of 6 GiB, with the name “VBOX HARDISK” (or “QEMU HARDISK” on UTM). We will create the primary partition here. | Execute fdisk /dev/sda to begin an interactive editing session with the /dev/sda disk. | Enter m to see a list of fdisk commands. Commands are generally all single letters. | Enter p to see the current list of primary partitions on the VM disk. Currently, it should show general disk information but list no primary partitions. | Enter n to create a new primary partition with the following configuration: . | Setting | Value | Comment | . | Partition Type | Default (p) | We have not discussed extended partitions yet and will stick with primary partitions. | . | Partition Number | Default (1) | Recall that MBR supports up to 4 primary partitions. Using 1 will create the partition /dev/sda1. | . | First Sector | Default (2048) | This indicates the hard disk sector number where the start of the primary partition will be. Note again that we will leave some free space left between the MBR (first sector) and the start of the primary partition for the bootloader. Don’t modify this value unless you know very well what you are doing. | . | Last Sector | Default (a large number) | The last sector of the primary partition. The difference between the first and last sector numbers plus 1 will give the total size of the new partition, which will be the entire disk size here. | . | Enter p to see the list of primary partitions (not yet committed). You should see the device /dev/sda1 with the start and end sector numbers used, and the type “Linux”. There is a separate fdisk command to create a Windows or OpenBSD primary partition. | If you made a mistake, you can delete the staged partition using d to start over. Once you are sure things are set up correctly, you can commit the changes to disk by entering w. This will also return you to the root shell. | . | . 6.2.3.2 - File System Configuration . Linux uses exactly one file system per primary partition (like Windows), so the “disk label” process in OpenBSD is unnecessary. | Create a new file system in /dev/sda1 by running mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1. This creates a new ext4 file system in /dev/sda1 that spans the entire primary partition. The output of mkfs.ext4 will print information referencing “inodes” and “superblock”, which we will cover later in the semester. | Mount the new file system to an existing directory by running mount /dev/sda1 /mnt. On OpenBSD, the new file system you created was automatically mounted for you on /mnt by the installation script. On Arch, you need to do this yourself. Right now, the kernel you are using is the one you booted from the CD, and the / root file system is the one from the CD (for simplicity’s sake). The command you ran will temporarily mount the file system in the /dev/sda1 partition in the /mnt directory so you can actually modify it during the rest of the installation procedure. | Running mount again will show all currently mounted file systems. At the end of the output, you should see the primary partition /dev/sda1 ext4 file system mounted in /mnt. | Execute ls -l /mnt to check that the new file system is empty, except for a “lost+found” directory, which can be ignored. | . 6.2.4 - System Installation and Configuration . | Once the file system is mounted, you can copy the file sets for Arch to the new file system. | File sets for Arch are available as packages from servers on the Internet. Run reflector to configure the closest servers for downloading file sets. | Run pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware. It may take a while. The pacstrap package manager will download the base package for cli utilities, linux package for the Arch kernel, and the linux-firmware package for updating hardware device controller firmware. All of these will be installed the the /mnt directory as a minimal Arch system. | . | Execute genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab to generate a new /etc/fstab file in the file system, which Arch will use later when booting to know determine the file system to use. Note: the >> means “append program stdout to the end of the file”, while a single > will overwrite the file. | Execute cat /mnt/etc/fstab to see the content of the new file. You should see that your /dev/sda1 primary partition will be the root file system once you boot Arch from the VM’s hard disk. | Switch to the new file system root by running arch-chroot /mnt. This will cause / to be located at /mnt, and the shell prompt will change from root@archiso ~ #&#x20; to [root@archiso /]# . | Execute ls to list the contents of the root directory in the new file system. You should see all the root-level Unix directories. | Configure date and time: . | Execute date and confirm that the VM is currently configured to use the default UTC time zone. | Execute ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/EST /etc/localtime. This will specify the correct time zone by creating a symlink to point at the right time zone. | Execute date again and confirm the date and time are correct. | . | Name the VM system . | Run cat > /etc/hostname. The cat program will wait for input on stdin. | Type in arch and hit Enter, then press Ctrl-d to quit to the shell. | Execute cat /etc/hostname to see the content of the new /etc/hostname file, and you should see arch on a single line. | . | Execute passwd to set the password for the root user. Use arch as the password. This will be a blind input, which you will input type twice. | . 6.2.4.1 - Package Manager and Network Configuration . | Execute pacman -S reflector to install reflector. We will use reflector to configure the new Arch system with the correct package servers. The reflector program we used before was from the CD, and is not yet available in the new file system. The pacman program is Arch’s standard package manager. You can use it to download and install thousands of different software packages, similar to pkg_add on OpenBSD and apt on Debian-based systems. | Execute reflector again to configure the new Arch system with package servers. | Execute pacman -S dhcpcd to install a DHCP client, otherwise the system will not be able to get an IP address and connect to the Internet when we boot from the hard disk later. | Find the VM’s network interface by running ip addr. You should see a network name like “enp0s1”, ignore loopback interfaces. Remember this name, as we will use it to configure systemd to automatically start the dhcpcd client at boot time. dhcpcd will automatically get an IP address for the VM’s Ethernet network interface to allow the VM to connect to the internet. | Configure systemd to start the dhcpcd client with your network name by running systemctl enable dhcpcd@&lt;network-name>.service. For example, with “enp0s1”, it would be systemctl enable dhcpcd@enp0s1.service. | Execute systemctl enable systemd-resolved.service to configure the DNS resolver, which translates computer names to IP addresses for you. The OpenBSD installation script performed this network configuration for you. | . 6.2.5 - Bootloader Installation . The last step is to install a bootloader, which will load the kernel into memory at boot time. The standard bootloader for Linux is GRUB. | Download GRUB: pacman -S grub. | Install GRUB: grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda. This installs GRUB after the master boot record and before the primary partition. | Generate the /boot/grub/grub.cfg configuration file for GRUB: grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg. This tells GRUB which menu entries to offer to the user when booting the VM. You can execute cat /boot/grub/grub.cfg to see the content of GRUB’s configuration file. It’s ugly. | Run exit to go back to the / root file system of the installation CD, then depending on your system, do the following: . windowsmacos Before you shut down the VM, go the the “Devices” menu of the VirtualBox window. Under “Optical drives”, select “Remove disk from virtual drive”. Click “Force Unmount” if necessary. Then execute shutdown now to stop the VM. Execute shutdown now to stop the VM. Once the system has shut down, close the window and open UTM settings for the VM. Under “IDE Drive”, select the virtual installation CD (archlinux-x86_64.iso), then select “Delete Drive”. | . 6.3 - Using Arch Linux . We will now create a user account and, like OpenBSD, need to give our user account admin privileges. 6.3.1 - Setting User Admin Privileges . | Start the Arch Linux VM. You should see a similar process as before, where the GRUB boot loader will copy the selected kernel to memory. After the kernel finishes booting, systemd will start and initialize all system services quietly. | Login as user root with password arch and configure a new user account: . | You will be logged in to a bash shell, where you can run ls -la to see the files in root’s home directory. | Execute setfont -d to double the font size if needed. | Create a new user (replace with your name and Stevens login): useradd -c 'Ryan Tsang' -m rtsang1. | Configure the user password, using arch as the password: passwd rtsang1. | Add your account to the wheel group: gpasswd -a rtsang1 wheel. | Install sudo: pacman -S sudo. | Install vi: pacman -S vi. | Configure sudo to allow all users in the “wheel” group to run commands as root: . | Edit the /etc/sudoers file: visudo. | In vi, type :125 and hit Enter to jump to line 125 in the file. This should be the first line that starts with # %wheel. | Uncomment the line (\\# is a line comment) by typing x with the cursor highlighting the character. Do this again to delete the space as well. The line should now start with %wheel, which will allow all users in the wheel group to execute commands as admin. | Type :wq and hit Enter to write the disk to file and quit vi. | . | Run exit to return to the login prompt. | . | . 6.3.2 - Starting the X Window GUI . As we did for OpenBSD, we will be manually installing the X Window GUI. | Login with your Stevens username using password arch. Run pwd to see where the current directory is located, and ls -la to show a detailed list of the current directory’s contents. | Install the X Window system as root: . sudo pacman -S xorg xorg-xinit xterm xorg-fonts-misc xorg-fonts-type1 . This will install the X Window system itself (xorg), xterm, and some fonts. | Install the Ice Window Manager: . sudo pacman -S icewm . | Configure X Window to use IceWM as its window manager by creating a file named .xinitrc in your home directory with the name of the window manager to use: . echo \"icewm\" > .xinitrc . Note the “.” at the beginning of the filename. This is common for configuration files in Unix. If you run cat .xinitrc, you should see only “icewm” appear on the console output. | Run startx to start X Window. | . 6.4 - Deliverables . To prove you have installed and used Arch successfully, you will submit a screenshot showing the Arch Linux kernel version and the output of the id command. | Enlarge the text in the xterm terminal window. | Hold Ctrl+Right-Click in the center of the xterm window to see text size options and select “Huge”. | . | Run the following commands: . | uname -a to show Arch Linux kernel version. | id to show username and user groups. | . | Take a screenshot of the Arch screen. You can use VirtualBox’s built-in option View -> Take Screenshot, or your host OS screenshot tools. An example can be seen in Figure Figure 2. Figure 2: Arch Linux Deliverable Example | Once you have a screenshot, you can shut down Arch by running sudo shutdown now in the xterm window and enter the root password. | After powerdown, you can delete the entire VM as it will not be used again in this course. You can also delete the ISO file. Congratulations on using Arch! . | . ",

    "title": "8 - Installing Debian",
    "content": "Now we will install Debian, which we will be using for the rest of th semester. If you have used Ubuntu before, it will feel very similar, as Ubuntu is based on Debian, and uses the same underlying package manager, apt. Debian is just as easy to use, but ships with less software and automatically shows the GRUB bootloader at boot time, which you will need to use in later assignments to boot your own Linux kernel. 8.1 - Creating the Debian VM . | Download Debian . | Visit the Debian homepage and ignore the “Download” button. Visit the “Other downloads” link instead. | Navigate to the section “Download an installation image” and visit the “small installation image” link. | Navigate to the section “Small CDs or USB sticks” and download the “amd64” option. | . | . From here, install instructions are different for VirtualBox and UTM. virtualboxutm 8.1.1 - VirtualBox . | Create a new VM: . | Give the name “cs492-debian” to the VM. | For “ISO image”, select debian-X.Y.Z-amd64-netinst.iso. Leave “Skip Unattended Installation” box unchecked. | Select the “Unattended Install” option and use the following configurations: . | Setting | Value | Comment | . | Username | Stevens username (e.g. rtsang1) | | . | Password | debian | | . | Hostname | debian | | . | Domain Name | Default | | . | Guest Additions | Yes | Use the VBoxGuestAdditions_X.Y.Z.iso file you downloaded previously. | . | Memory | Maximum recommended | Use the limit of the memory green zone | . | Processors | Maximum recommended | Use the limit of the cpu green zone. You will need the power when you manually compile the linux kernel in the next assignment. | . | Virtual Hard Disk Size | 60 GB | The OS alone requires at least 6 GB, rounded up to 20 GB for additional software, such as VS Code, another 20 GB for a “working” copy of the Linux kernel source code, and another 20 GB for a backup of compiled kernel code. The backup will be needed if you bork the working copy in programming assignment 2, as saving compiled artifacts in a known good state will reduce compile time if you need to nuke your working copy. | . | . | . VirtualBox will create the VM with an empty 60 GB hard disk and virtual CD, then automatically boot the VM and run the install process automatically. If you watch carefully, you should see the following: . | The VM boots the Linux kernel | DHCP will configure the VM’s enp0s3 Ethernet network interface to connect to the internet | A partitioning tool will create a primary partition with a new file system | The base Debian system will be installed to the file system and configured | Many extra software packages will be installed (e.g. Python, LibreOffice, etc.) | GRUB will be installed | More configuration and cleanup | Once the system is ready, the install CD will be automatically ejected and the VM will reboot. | VM boots from hard disk | GRUB bootloader starts | Linux kernel starts | systemd starts | Login prompt displays in the default GNOME desktop environment, which uses the Wayland compositor instead of X Window. | . 8.1.2 - UTM . Unlike VirtualBox, UTM cannot automatically install Debian, and you will need to use Debian’s installation GUI, which is very similar to setting up Ubuntu. | Create a VM with the name cs492-debian and 60 GB disk size. Refer to Section 3.2.1. | In the VM settings, change the CPU to “qemu64” (end of the list). | Start the VM. | Install Debian using the default “Graphical install” option with the following configuration: . | Setting | Value | Comment | . | Language | Default (English) | | . | Location | Default (United States) | | . | Keyboard | Default (American English) | | . | Hostname | debian | | . | Domain name | Default (none) | | . | Root password | debian | | . | Full Name | Your name | | . | Username | Your Stevens login (e.g. rtsang1) | | . | Password | debian | | . | Time Zone | Default (Eastern) | | . | Partitioning Method | Default (Guided - use entire disk) | | . | Partitioning Scheme | Default (All files in one partiton) | | . | Write changes to disk? | Yes | | . | Scan extra installation media? | Default (No) | | . | Debian archive mirror country | Default (United States) | | . | Debian archive mirror | Default (deb.debian.org) | | . | HTTP proxy information | Default (none) | | . | Pacticipate in package usage survey | Default (No) | | . | Choose software to install | Default | | . | Install GRUB to your primary drive? | Default (Yes) | | . | Device for bootloader installation | /dev/sda | | . | Remove the virtual installation CD. | . 8.2 - Using Debian . | Start the VM and log in with your debian password. | Skip your way through the “Welcome” windows. | If you do not see a toolbar at the bottom of the window, click the “Activities” menu in the top left corner. You should now see a toolbar with various applications that come preinstalled on Debian. We will not use these for the course. | Select the 3x3 grid of dots to see more applications, and find the “Terminal” application. Right-Click “Terminal” and select “Pin to Dash”, which will add the application to the toolbar. Then open the “Terminal” application. | Execute ls -la to list the files in your home directory, and pwd to print the path to your home directory. | Give yourself administrative privileges to use sudo: . | Switch to the root user account by running su - (which means “substitute user” and historically, “superuser”). You will need to login using the root credentials, debian. | As root, add your user account to the sudo group (unlike OpenBSD and Arch, which use the wheel group): . usermod -aG sudo rtsang1 . | Run exit to return to the user shell and restart Debian. | Click the battery icon in the upper right corner of the desktop. | Click the power icon and select “Restart” and confirm. | . | Log back in for you changes to take effect. | . | . 8.2.1 - Exploring Debian . | Run the following commands to have a look around your Debian VM . | sudo fdisk -l . This should show the VM’s disk is named /dev/sda and that it has a /dev/sda1 “Linux” bootable primary partition, inidcated by a * in the output. There is also a /dev/sda5 swap partition, which is used by the kernel’s virtual memory system, as we will see later in the semester. Note also that although the MBR partition system only allows 5 primary partitions, the swap partition has index 5. This is because the swap partition is not a primary partition, but an extended partition, which itself is in the /dev/sda2 primary partion, set up to support extended partitions. This is why /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda5 have about the same start sector and size. | cat /etc/fstab . This will show your / root file system is of type ext4. You can also see the swap extended partition if of the special type “swap”, meaning it does not contain a file system. | mount . This will show that the /dev/sda1 ext4 primary partition is mounted at /. | df -h . This will show a usage summary for various file systems. /dev/sda1 should currently be using about 5 GB, with another 50GB or so available. | ls /boot . This is where your linux kernel is stored. You can also find there the “grub” directory that contains the grub.cfg configuration file for the GRUB bootloader. | which gcc . This will print /usr/bin/gcc if C compiler is already installed. If it is not, you can install it and other C development packages by running: . sudo apt install build-essential . The which command is used to find where different programs are installed on your system if they are in your current PATH. Try doing the same with the vi text editor, the make build system, the python3 interpreter, and the firefox web browser. You can see a long list of default installed programs by running ls /usr/bin. | . | Installing software . | Use the apt package manager to install software on Debian, for example, emacs: sudo apt install emacs-nox . | You can search for available packages in the debian package repository. | . | To shut down the VM, execute sudo shutdown now in a terminal window, or user the GUI option. Shut down your VM now. Note: Never shut down the VM by closing the window in your host machine! Doing so can corrupt the virtual file system in the VM, and while the file system is capable of some self-repair, it is not advisable to rely on it. Only do so if the VM is truly frozen or unresponsive. | . 8.2.2 - Configure Host File Sharing . virtualboxutm 8.2.2.1 - VirtualBox . | In the “General” menu, under “Advanced”, change both “Shared Clipboard” and “Drag’n’Drop” to be “bidiractional”. This will allow you to copy and paste between Debian and your host OS. | Set up a shared directory with the host: . | On you host OS, create a new folder named “shared” anywhere you like. | In the VirtualBox VM “Settings”, select “Shared folders”. | Add a new shared folder by selecting the green “+” icon and configure as follows: . | Setting | Value | Comment | . | Folder Path | shared | Use the “shared” folder you just created | . | Folder Name | shared | | . | Mount point | /mnt/shared | This will be the location of the shared folder in Debian. | . | Auto-mount | Yes | This will make sharing happen automatically when the VM starts. | . | . | Start the VM, log in, and open Terminal. | Execute ls /mnt/shared to confirm you can see the content of the shared folder on your host. | In your home directory, run ln -s /mnt/shared shared, then confirm the symlink works by running ls shared. You should see the content of the shared folder. | . 8.2.2.2 - UTM . You have options on UTM, though both have their downsides. You can use SPICE WebDAV, which has an easier setup, or VirtFS, which will have better performance. The instructions here are for setting up shared folders via VirtFS: . | Create a folder named shared on your host OS, wherever you like. | Before launching the VM, configure the VM to use VirtFS for sharing: . | Open VM settings and go to “Sharing” | Ensure “Enable Clipboard Sharing” is checked | Select “VirtFS” for “Directory Share Mode” | Select the path to the shared directory you created | . | Launch the VM and open Terminal . | Add the shared folder to the file system table (fstab): . | Run sudo vi /etc/fstab to edit the fstab file with vi. | The following commands are case sensitive: . | Type G to go the start of the last line of the file. | Type o to insert a new line below the current line and enter Insert mode. | Add the following lines to the file: . # UTM Shared Foldershare /mnt/shared 9p trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L,rw,_netdev,nofail,auto 0 0 . | Type Esc to leave Insert mode. | Type :wq to write the changes to file and quit vi. | . | . | To avoid permissions issues, we will use bindfs to then mount the /mnt/shared folder to a folder in our user home directory. | Install bindfs: sudo apt install bindfs . | We will likely need to map the user and group ids of files in /mnt/shared, so we need to find out the user and group IDs of the guest and host machines. | In Debian, run id and find the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID). By default, these are typically both 1000. | In a host terminal, run id and do the same. | Now add the following lines to the fstab, following the same general procedure as above, and replacing bracketed fields (e.g. &lt;guest_uid>) as needed: . # bindfs mount to remap UID/GID/mnt/shared /home/&lt;username>/shared fuse.bindfs map=&lt;host_uid>/&lt;guest_uid>:@&lt;host_gid>/@&lt;guest_gid>,x-systemd.require=/mnt/shared,_netdev,nofail,auto 0 0 . | . | Restart the VM by running sudo reboot . | Test the shared directory: . | In your host OS, create a test file named test.txt in the shared directory you created. | In Debian, edit it by running echo \"testing\" >> shared/test.txt. | In your host OS, check that the change appears by running cat test.txt from a terminal in your host. | . | . 8.3 - Deliverables . To prove you have installed and used Debian successfully, you will submit a screenshot showing the Debian kernel version and the output of the id command. | Enlarge the text in the xterm terminal window. | Hold Ctrl+Right-Click in the center of the xterm window to see text size options and select “Huge”. | . | Run the following commands: . | uname -a to show Debian kernel version. | id to show username and user groups. | . | Take a screenshot of the Debian screen. You can use VirtualBox’s built-in option View -> Take Screenshot, or your host OS screenshot tools. An example can be seen in Figure Figure 3. Figure 3: Debian Deliverable Example | Once you have a screenshot, you can shut down Debian and delete the ISO installation image. Congratulations on using debian! . | . ",

Never delete or modify this file in any way. Use Debian’s battery icon menu (upper right corner of the Debian desktop) to restart the virtual machine.

    "title": "3 - Build Your “Working” Kernel",
    "content": "3.1 - Prerequisites . | Before compiling your own “working” kernel, you must first install some tools and the Linux kernel source code. So, after booting the “known good” kernel (as indicated above), log in, open a terminal window, and execute the following command to install all the software required to configure and compile the Linux kernel source code: . sudo apt install build-essential pahole libelf-dev libncurses-dev libssl-dev flex bison . | build-essential is a software package that depends on all the development libraries and header files and basic development tools that you need, so installing it guarantees that all those things are present on your VM. | pahole and libelf-dev are a set of tools and a library to handle Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) files. | libncurses-dev is a library to create text-based user interfaces, which is used by make menuconfig below. | libssl-dev is a library that provides cryptographic functions and secure networking. | flex is a lexer/scanner generator. | bison is a parser generator. | . | Install the Linux kernel source code: . | Execute sudo apt install linux-source&#x20; This automatically selects the right version of the Linux kernel source code, based on the version of the “known good” kernel which is currently executing on your VM. | Execute ls -l /usr/src and you should see one file named linux-source-X.Y.tar.xz. tar is the standard file archive format for Unix, and xz is one among many compressed file formats on Unix (other common ones are gz and bz2). Together, tar and xz give you a compressed file archive, similar in spirit to the zip compressed file archive format which is used a lot on Microsoft Windows. | Execute cd ~ to make sure that you are in your home directory. | Decompress and extract the kernel source code you just installed: . tar -xavf /usr/src/linux-source-X.Y.tar.xz . | -x means “extract”. | -a means “auto-compress” or “auto-decompress” depending on context. | -v means “verbose”, to see the names of the extracted files as the extraction happens | -f specifies the name of the compressed archive file. | . After doing this, you should have in your home directory a new directory named linux-source-X.Y. Use ls to see it. | Use du -s -h linux-source-X.Y to see how big the Linux kernel source code is. | Change the name of this new linux-source-X.Y directory: . mvlinux-source-X.Y pa2 . | Execute cd pa2 to move into the top directory of your Linux kernel source code. Use ls to have a look at the different directories there. | . | . 3.2 - Build Configuration . | Create the configuration file for the kernel: . | For simplicity, we will copy then modify the configuration file for the “known good” kernel which is currently executing on your VM: . cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config . Again, the command uname -r tells you exactly which kernel version you are currently executing on the VM, so we can use the result of this command to copy the right kernel configuration file from the /boot directory into the current directory containing your Linux kernel source code. | Execute make menuconfig to modify this configuration file. You should then get a text-based user interface which allows you to easily modify your kernel configuration file. | Press Enter to go into the “General setup” sub-menu, press the down arrow twice on your keyboard to go down two lines, then Enter to select “Local version - append to kernel release”. In the new text window that appears, enter a minus sign - followed by your login name (which is also your Stevens login name), followed by -pa2. For example: -rtsang1-pa2 (replace my login name with yours, obviously). Do not add any space before, inside, or after this text. This piece of text is going to be added to the version of the Linux kernel you are going to compile, so that later you can easily recognize which kernel is yours. This will be your “working” kernel. Press Enter to select “OK” and you should be back in the previous sub-menu, with the text you just typed is now showing between () parentheses in front of the name of the “Local version - append to kernel release” sub-menu. Press the right arrow on your keyboard to select “Exit” and then Enter to go back to the previous top-level menu. | Select Save and press Enter. In the new window, check that the default “.config” file name is correct and press Enter to save your new configuration file. Then select “Exit” to quit the “menuconfig” user interface and go back to the usual Unix shell. | Double check the differences between the original kernel configuration file and the one you just modified: . diff /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config . In the output you should see that the kernel variable CONFIG_LOCALVERSION is now defined to be the piece of text -rtsang1-pa2 (except with your own login name) while before it was the empty string (ignore any change for CONFIG_CC_VERSION_TEXT and for SALT, SIG, and KEY stuff, these changes are irrelevant). You are now ready to compile the Linux kernel source code for your “working” kernel! . | . | . 3.3 - Compilation . | Execute nproc to see how many processors your VM is using (this should be the same number you indicated in the settings of the VM in VirtualBox or UTM). | You might also want to go into the settings of your host operating system (Microsoft Windows or Apple macOS) and make sure that the power settings of your computer are set for maximum performance (for example, in Microsoft Windows, click on the battery icon at the right end of the bottom taskbar, then move the slider to “Best performance”); you can undo this setting later again after you are finished compiling the kernel. | Also make sure that your host OS is not set up to automatically suspend or shut down your host computer if you do not move the mouse or whatnot for a while. Again you can undo this later when you are finished compiling the kernel. | If you are using a laptop computer, also make sure that it is plugged into an electric socket, otherwise your host OS might automatically throttle your computer’s performance to save the battery. | Ensure that Debian does not suspend itself while you are in the middle of compiling your kernel. Click with your right mouse button on the Debian desktop background, select “Settings”, then “Power”, then click on “Automatic suspend” and turn off both “On Battery Power” and “Plugged In”. | . | Now we are ready to compile the whole Linux kernel source code using all the VM’s processors in parallel, to speed up things: . make -j $(nproc) all . Wait an hour or two (or more). You will know the compilation is over when your computer’s fan stops making more noise than usual… If for some reason you need to stop the compilation before it is finished, just press Ctrl-c on the keyboard. You can then re-start the compilation later using the same command again, and it will automatically restart from where it left off. If for some reason the compilation fails, it might be hard to see why it failed because you are compiling different parts of the kernel code in parallel. In that case, you can execute just make all to restart the compilation from where it failed but this time in sequential mode on a single CPU, which will make it much easier to see what the problem is. Then contact your nearest Course Assistant. If you look at the output of the make command while it is compiling the code, you will see different abbreviations: . | CC is when compiling a C file to get a .o object file (a file containing binary CPU instructions) | LD is when linking (gluing) multiple object files together | AR is when creating a library (a .a archive file of object files, which later will be linked with the rest of the kernel) | [M] means that this code is part of a dynamically loadable kernel module, not part of the monolithic Linux kernel proper. | . | Execute du -s -h . to see how much disk space the current directory containing the whole compiled Linux source code takes (it should be around 23 GB). | . 3.4 - Install and Boot . | When compiling the kernel, all the kernel modules are also compiled at the same time. We now need to install these new kernel modules: sudo make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install . This can take a little while, and must be done as root (the system administrator) hence the use of sudo here. The INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 argument given to the make command tells make to strip extra debugging information from the modules when installing them, which saves around 2GB of disk space. | Once the modules are installed, you can execute ls -l /usr/lib/modules and you should see in the output a directory with a name that has your login name and pa2 at the end, which is where the modules were installed. The command du -s -h /usr/lib/modules/* should show you that all the different directories there (the one for your own modules, as well as the one for the “known good” kernel) are about 400MB in size. | Now we can install the new “working” kernel itself: . sudo make install . Do not worry about any “Please install the Linux kernel “header” files matching the current kernel” message in the command’s output; we would need this only if we were to try to use our Debian VM as the host for another VM on top of it! . | Execute ls -l /boot and you will see that make installed several files there, all of which have your login name and “pa2” at the end of their name: . | config-X.Y…-rtsang1-pa2: a copy of the .config file you used for compiling your kernel (you can check this using the diff command, for example; see above) . | initrd.img-X.Y…-rtsang1-pa2: the kernel’s “initial RAM disk” which the kernel only uses at boot time (see here for more information if you are curious) . | System.map-X.Y…-rtsang1-pa2: a list of your kernel’s symbols (the function names and variable names inside the kernel) . | vmlinuz-X.Y…-rtsang1-pa2: your very own “working” kernel! . | . As part of the kernel’s installation, the configuration file for the GRUB bootloader is also automatically updated so that the bootloader now knows about your new kernel. | READ FIRST: Use Debian’s battery icon menu to restart the virtual machine. As soon as you see the white-on-blue-green menu of the GRUB boot loader, press the down arrow key on the keyboard to select the second menu entry named “Advanced options for Debian GNU/Linux”. You have only 5 seconds to do this! Then press Enter to get a sub-menu. In the sub-menu, select now your own “working” kernel, which has your login name and “pa2” at the end of its name (but again not the “recovery mode” one) and press Enter to boot your own kernel. Happiness ensues. | . 3.5 - Deliverables . | After booting your own “working” kernel, log in, open a terminal window, use Ctrl-+ to increase the font size of the terminal window, and execute uname -a (which should show a kernel name with your own login name and “pa2” at the end of it) and then id. Take a screenshot and save it as a picture somewhere on your host computer, you will need to submit it later on Canvas (more details about this at the end of this document). Make sure the kernel version and your login name (Stevens login name) are clearly visible inside the terminal window in your screenshot. For example: . | . Congratulations on compiling and booting your first Linux kernel! . Now create in your home directory another new directory that you will use for submitting your assignment (again, use your own Stevens login name): . cd; mkdir rtsang1-pa2 . Then copy your “working” kernel configuration file into your submission directory: . cp pa2/.config rtsang1-pa2 . 3.6 - Backup . To finish this part of the assignment, create a backup copy of the kernel source code you just compiled, just in case. There are 2 options: . | (Long) Do a recursive copy: cp -p -r pa2 pa2-backup . | -r means to do a recursive copy that will automatically copy the directory and all of its subdirectories | -p preserves the file timestamps when copying. GNU Make uses timestamps to determine if a file needs to be recompiled, and preserving the timestamp will prevent it from being recompiled unnecessarily. | . | (Longer) Create a compressed archive: tar -cJvf pa2-backup.tar.xz pa2/ . | . The recursive copy is slightly faster, but will take up more disk space on the VM (23 GB at time of writing). Using tar will take longer due to compression, but will take up much less space (2.9 GB at time of writing). Later, when doing the rest of this assignment, if you make a big mistake inside your “pa2” directory, such as accidentally deleting some files, you can restore them from your backup. (tar can extract single files from an archived directory) . In the worst case, if you do not know how to fix the mistake, you can always completely delete your “pa2” directory (cd ~; rm -rf pa2) and re-create it using the backup copy (cp -p -r pa2-backup pa2 or tar -xJvf pa2-backup.tar.xz).

Make sure you use the proper C macro to define your system call (see linux/syscalls.h and the gettimeofday syscall for an example). The code of your system call must always return a signed long integer (long) as result. Your system call should do the following: . | If the string pointer given as argument is NULL then your system call must immediately return -1. | If the string length is larger than 32 (where the string length is its total number of characters, including the \\0 string terminator character), then your system call must immediately return -1. | Copy the string from user space to kernel space. | Use printk to print “before: “ followed by the string. Note: whenever you use printk, always make sure that the string you want to print is terminated with a \\n newline character, otherwise the string will not immediately appear in the kernel logs when your code is executed. | Replace all occurrences of a lowercase vowel letter (a, e, i, o, u) in the string with the first letter of your login name, in uppercase (for example, given my rtsang1 login name, the letters a, e, i, o, and u are all replaced with the uppercase letter R). | Use printk to print after:&#x20; followed by the modified string. | Copy the modified string from kernel space to user space. | The system call then returns as result the number of character replacements performed in step 5. | . In your code, make use of the following kernel functions from include/linux/uaccess.h and as much as possible: . | Function | Description | . | get_user | gets a simple variable from user space | . | put_user | puts a simple variable to user space | . | clear_user | clears, or zeros, a block in user space | . | copy_to_user | copies a block of data from the kernel to user space | . | copy_from_user | copies a block of data from the user space to the kernel | . | strnlen_user | gets the size of a string buffer in user space | . | strncpy_from_user | copies a string from user space into the kernel | . IBM has archived documentation that may prove useful. If any of the above functions fail, return -EFAULT. Make sure your code properly checks for errors when using each of these functions (refer to the syscalls used in https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/time/time.c#L140). Do not use a module to implement your system call. | Modify other files in the Linux kernel source code as necessary: . | arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl: Add your syscall to the syscall table. (Use tabs, not spaces between fields) . | include/linux/syscalls.h: Add your syscall prototype to the header file. | my_syscall/Makefile: Add your syscall to the build system. This file should only contain: . obj-y += my_syscall.o . | Makefile: Update the build system to build your syscall. Make the following modification: . core-y := my_syscall/ . | . | Give your system call the the last number in the syscall table +1 (463 at time of writing). | Keep a list somewhere of all the files you modify, because later you will need to copy them to your submission directory. | . | Recompile your “working” kernel, the same way you did it in Section 3.3. Some of the files you need to modify are referenced throughout the kernel’s code, so, when recompiling, the make command then needs to recompile most of the kernel code again, which again takes a very long time. So make sure you modify the files correctly on the first try, so you do not have to recompile the whole kernel over and over. If you only need to change your my_syscall/my_syscall.c file then recompiling the kernel should take only about 5 minutes since the rest of the kernel’s code will not need to be recompiled again in this case. | Reinstall your “working” kernel and its associated modules if and only if compilation succeeded. See Section 3.4. When installing your modified “working” kernel, the previous version of your “working” kernel will be renamed with an extra “.old” extension at the end of its name. You can just ignore this one. | Reboot the virtual machine and make sure that you use the GRUB bootloader to select the correct kernel when rebooting (your “working” kernel with the “-rtsang1-pa2” name, that now contains the code for your own system call). | If your “working” kernel panics (crashes) on boot for some reason, reboot the VM using your “known good” kernel and fix the problem in the code of your “working” kernel. | . | After you have booted the correct kernel, do the following to double-check that the kernel you are now running actually knows about your system call: . | Ensure your syscall symbol is in the System.map: . grep rtsang1_syscall /boot/System.map-*-pa2 . (using your login instead of mine of course) . You should get a dozen different names related to your system call in the output of the command. | Ensure your syscall symbol is in /proc/kallsyms: . grep rtsang1_syscall /proc/kallsyms . You should see the same output as above. | . If the output the above commands is empty, then the kernel that you are currently running does not know about your system call, which means that either you booted the wrong kernel or you did something wrong somewhere. Re-read this whole section and try again. | . 5.2 - Testing The System Call . In your submission directory (cd ~/rtsang1-pa2), write the C code for a user-space test program called syscall.c that invokes your system call. Since your system call does not have a corresponding C wrapper function available in the C standard library, you must directly use the syscall function of the C standard library to call your system call (see OS concepts lecture notes for an example). Your code must invoke your system call twice: . | once for the case where the string size is larger than 32. | once for the case where the string size is less than 32. | . In both cases, your C program must print on the screen: . | The string given to the syscall, before the system call happens. | The return value of the syscall. | The string after the system call, even if it has not been modified. | . You can directly use the system call number 463 in your C code. The strings that you use in your code must be defined as local variables (the same way it is done for example on slide 19 of the “OS Concepts and Structure” lecture notes), not as string constants that you directly give to the system call as argument. This is because, when your code executes inside a process, all the string constants from your code are stored in a part of the “data” segment of the process’s address space which is read-only (since string constants are… constant), which in turn means that your kernel system call would fail when trying to modify those strings. Local variables are stored in the process’s stack, which is read-write and your system call will then be able to modify those strings. 5.3 - Deliverables . You must provide a single screenshot that shows two Debian terminal windows side by side: . | one window must show the kernel log (with your system call’s output visible in it, when the string given as argument to the system call is short enough) | the other window must show the output of the uname -a command followed by the execution of your user-space test program. | . Save the screenshot somewhere on your host computer, you will need to submit it later on Gradescope (more details about this below). For example: . ",

    "content": ". | Once both your system call and your user-space test program work, copy the code of the system call, plus any other kernel file you modified, into your submission directory (your user-space test program must already be there): | . cd ~/pa2; cp -p -r my_syscall &lt;any other file you modified> ~/rtsang1-pa2 . | In your submission directory, create a file named login.txt that contains your Stevens login ID: . cd ~/rtsang1-pa2echo \"rtsang1\" > login.txt . The autograder uses this to confirm you have submitted all necessary files. You must include this file or you will fail the autograder! . | In your submission directory, create a PDF file named screenshots.pdf that contains: . | Your full name. | The Stevens Honor pledge. | The three screenshots you created above: . | one showing that you compiled your own “working” kernel (Section 3) | one showing how your kernel module works (Section 4) | one showing how your system call and your user-space test program work (Section 5) | . Make sure the screenshots are clearly readable. Also add a short explanation before each screenshot so the Course Assistants know what you are trying to show on those screenshots. | . At this point the submission directory (rtsang1-pa2) must contain all the files you have created or modified during this assignment (including the kernel .config configuration file, which you can only see in the submission directory by using the ls -a command). If you install the tree utility program and run the command tree -a rtsang1-pa2, you should see the following structure: . rtsang1-pa2├── .config├── login.txt├── module│   ├── Makefile│   └── rtsang1.c├── my_syscall│   ├── Makefile│   └── my_syscall.c├── &lt;other files>└── syscall.c . | Install the zip program on your virtual machine (sudo apt install zip) and then create a ZIP file of your submission directory: . cd; zip -r rtsang1-pa2.zip rtsang1-pa2 . The -r flag means to zip all the subdirectories recursively: do not forget it! . Remember to use your own login name instead of mine. | Once you have correctly created the file rtsang1-pa2.zip, copy it to the host OS using your shared folder, double-check its content to make sure it contains everything (see Section 7). | Submit your submission zip file on Gradescope and confirm autograder sanity checks pass. Solutions will be graded manually. Autograder tests are not exhaustive. | . After the deadline for this assignment has passed, you can delete the backup copy of your “working” kernel: rm -rf ~/pa2-backup . It is up to you whether you delete the compiled source code of your “working” kernel or not (rm -rf ~/pa2), you will not need it anymore this semester. You can delete it after the deadline for this assignment has passed, if you want to save VM disk space, or delete it only at the end of the semester, or keep it for ever as a souvenir! . ",
